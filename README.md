# CalendCar App
It's a booking management system. We implemented the CRUD functionalities over the fullCalendarJS library. 
  

## Setup
1. Take the db file called **"calendcar.sql"** in the root directory, and import it to your local/remote server tool like **"wamp"** or **"xamp"**. 
2. Launch a php sever by typing **php -S locahost:8082" (you can choose whatever port or host you want to execute it).
3. Make sure that your **db configuration** in the file **./models/ConnectionDB.php** matches exactly with the server where your db is launched.
